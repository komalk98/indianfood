# Install the bahmni command line program (Choose the version you want)
yum install -y https://repo.mybahmni.org/releases/bahmni-installer-0.93-219.noarch.rpm
 
# download the postgres repo rpm. This is because wget fails to verify the keys.
# If you prefer the default download by wget, then you have to install the ca-certificates module
# and configure wget. Alternatively you can use curl like below.
# for more info check: https://talk.openmrs.org/t/bahmni-0-92-install-on-centos-7-6-minimal-fails/25416/48
 
# download postgres rpm
rm -f /opt/pgdg-redhat-repo-*
cd /opt && wget https://repo.mybahmni.org/releases/pgdg-redhat-repo-42.0-23.noarch.rpm
 
# Confirm that the bahmni command is correctly installed (you should see a help message for the command)
bahmni --help
  
# Now setup a configuration file for bahmni command in /etc/bahmni-installer.
# Note, before running the below command check whether the /etc/bahmni-installer/setup.yml already exists or not.
curl -L https://tinyurl.com/yyoj98df >> /etc/bahmni-installer/setup.yml
 
# Edit the setup.yml file and add the Bahmni Repo URL
vi /etc/bahmni-installer/setup.yml
bahmni_repo_url: https://repo.mybahmni.org/releases/
  
# Confirm the contents of the file. It should look like this file: (https://goo.gl/R8ekg5)
cat /etc/bahmni-installer/setup.yml
 
# The above setup.yml, has a timezone entry. You can change it to suit your timezone if you like. For valid options
# please read this document: https://bahmni.atlassian.net/wiki/display/BAH/List+Of+Configurable+Installation+Variables
 
# Optionally set the inventory file name to local in BAHMNI_INVENTORY environment variable. This way you won't need to use the '-i local' switch every time you use the 'bahmni' command.
# You can also configure custom inventory file instead of local.
echo "export BAHMNI_INVENTORY=local" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
 
# configure components you require. Edit the inventory file (or your custom inventory file)
vi /etc/bahmni-installer/local
 
  
# Now fire the installer. If you have exported the variable as above you can ignore the "-i local" option. 
bahmni -i local install 
 
  
# The installation should be done in about 15 - 30 minutes depending on your internet speed.
# Verify installed components using the command:
yum list installed | grep bahmni
